# Python-Interpreter-With-Graphs

Simple interpreter which can do basic maths operations. It can also plot basic functions. 

***Graph: Commands List***
```
Plot y=f(x) # example: Plot y=sin(x^2)

Pane x 10 y 12 # Shifts the origin by (10,12) units

Pane x 10px y 12px #Shifts the origin by (10px,12px)

GraphScale*=2 # increases the scale by a factor of 2

reset() #resets the graph to defaults

clear() #Clears the interpreter. Namespaces and functions remain

clear_all() #Clears everything including graphs and namespaces

clear_fns() #Clears all functions
```

# To run the program
Install Tkinter if not installed. (Tkinter is generally installed in python distrbutions)

run `python GUI.py`
